        <h2>HTML</h2>
        
        <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p> Hello World! As a bootcamp student I wanted a website that I along with other could quickly and easily access, organize, read and share my notes later down the road. The first section is on HTML organized into vocabulary, a list of elements with a description on function and a list of attributes with descriptions. 

          </p>
        
        <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li><term>Tag: Also known as opening and closing tags, most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside. Closing tags begin with a forward slash</li></term><br />

            <li><term>Body Element: Defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the user. Body Elements are also examples of Semantic HTML elements. </li></term><br />

            <li><term>Child Elements: Are elements nested inside other elements.</li></term><br />

            <li><term>Semantic HTML Elements: Name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on the webpage. Makes YOUR HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. Semantic HTML elements also play an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variaty of users.</li></term><br />

            <li><term>Decleration: Tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. Declerations are not case sensitive as HTML elements are.</li></term><br />

            <li><term>Metadata: Data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Contained in the header not typically seen by users, but contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li></term><br />

            <li><term>SEO: Search Engine Optimization</li></term><br />
          </ul>
