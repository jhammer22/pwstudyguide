# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This was my first project created during Prework for the coding bootcamp I am attending. It contains HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript. I have horrible handwriting so this gives me a place to have all my notes legible. Coming from no real coding background I had never used the terminal had no idead how to read or write any programming language. After building this simple project I can now say I have at least the basics down. As I continue to go thru my bootcamp I will continue to improve and add notes in sections along with add new sections and features.

## Installation

## Usage

Start with git section learn the terminal, then move onto HTML, CSS and finally JavaScript. All sections include basic theories, keywords, syntax and definitions. Will update as new features are added.
